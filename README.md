# Yellow Brick Road

@vaidehijoshi and I built a LinkedIn scraper that compiles alumni information from a specific company.

The original intent was to find all Flatiron School alumni and discover what companies and industries they were employed at. This scraper searches LinkedIn and compiles all relevant job titles, company names, locations, and industries.

Basically, we wanted to see what our futures looked like post grad.

* Limitation: LinkedIn limits profile views to a maximum of 100 profiles.c
