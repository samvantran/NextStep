YBR is a LinkedIn scraper that compiles data on the alumni of a specified company.

The following information is compiled:

* Job titles
* New company names
* Industries
* Current locations

The original intent of this application was to locate Flatiron School alumni and find out what companies and industries they were now employed at. As a current FS student, I wanted to know what my potential future looked like post-grad.

* Limitation: LinkedIn limits profile views to a maximum of 100 profiles on a Basic LinkedIn account.
